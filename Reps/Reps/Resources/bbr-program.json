  "programDetails": "## Program Overview\nWatch the overview video for instructions on how to use the program most efficiently, common mistakes, and tips for maximizing progress.\nhttps://youtu.be/wq0HsRcLl28\n\n## Understanding the \"Why\"\nA huge component of the exercises is \"education\" of the brain, rather than \"mindless\" corrective exercises. Intention matters.\nhttps://youtu.be/kd-Ram-Y6gc\n\n## How to Breathe\nBreathing is foundational to this program. Exhale slowly through mouth, inhale fully through nose. The longer and more relaxed, the better.\nhttps://youtu.be/bt6amVTDuxs\n\nIf you are struggling to get a full exhale, try using a balloon or straw in a short-seated position:\nhttps://youtu.be/7zycDnqkOcA\n\n## Materials Needed\n- Wall space\n- A chair\n- A foam roller\n- A pillow (maybe two)\n- Resistance band (Phase 4)\n- Optional: wedges for foot drills\n\n## Frequency\n3-4 sessions per week minimum, daily is ideal. Complete at least 14 days of each phase before advancing. Do not skip weeks.\n\n## Effort Level\nStart at 3/10 effort, never go beyond 5/10. This is the biggest mistake people make. If you aren't seeing results, you're likely trying too hard.\n\n## Exercise Order\nDo exercises in the order presented. Complete all sets of one exercise before moving to the next. Each exercise opens up space for the next one.\n\n## Asymmetrical Considerations\nEvery exercise is programmed for both sides. For those wanting asymmetrical work, determine your lateralization:\nhttps://youtu.be/GYTsaqHgtRY\n\n## Shoewear\nProper footwear matters for mobility. Wear shoes as often as possible, even during exercises:\nhttps://youtu.be/GWihpCoeorQ\n\n## Not Seeing Results?\nCommon reasons: exercises not performed properly, cervical/dental issues, or trying too hard. Watch this for guidance:\nhttps://youtu.be/VhdDIZNlRGU\n\n## Keys to Success\n- Breathing (without engaging the neck)\n- Not trying too hard (3/10 effort)\n- Understanding WHY you are doing each exercise\n- Daily consistency",
